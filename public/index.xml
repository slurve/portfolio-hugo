      <description>Hi there. I&#39;m Tom Rose, a freelance WordPress developer with over 20 years experience building websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have a strong passion for web standards, clean code and keeping things simple. I love building websites that display content clearly, load fast and are easy to navigate.
I mainly work out of my home office in West Philadelphia, but Iâ€™m always excited to join teams onsite when possible.</description>

A lot of time was spent on the list template, which is used extensively throughout the website. WebDevStudios did an amazing job hooking into a maps API to bring these pages to life.</description>
