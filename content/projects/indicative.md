Indicative is a behavioral analytics platform based in New York City. I worked with a talented freelance designer to build a custom WordPress theme for their main marketing website. The theme includes custom components built with the amazing [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) plugin. With ACF, editors in the Indicative office can easily add [pricing info](https://www.indicative.com/pricing/), [product details](https://www.indicative.com/product/), [blog posts](https://www.indicative.com/blog/) and the like.
