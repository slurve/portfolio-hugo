United World Mission equips leaders and establishes churches around the world. Working with [Rethink Creative](https://rethinkcreative.com/), a design shop based in New Jersey, I built a framework that allows users to [search for opportunities](https://uwm.org/go/) and [donate money to workers and projects](https://uwm.org/give/). These pages utilize JavaScript and WordPress' amazing taxonomy API to return data quickly and accurately.
