Curalate is social commerce platform that helps brands connect with users and buyers. I worked with the in-house design and marketing teams (often onsite at their Philadelphia headquarters) to build a custom, responsive WordPress theme to promote their platform. The project included development of a [blog](https://www.curalate.com/blog/) with searchable taxonomies, a sortable [partnerships](https://www.curalate.com/resources/partnerships/) section, various [demo form landing pages](https://lp.curalate.com/demo) and a [developers guide](https://developers.curalate.com/).
