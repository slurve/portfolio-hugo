Zignal Labs is a media analytics platform based in San Francisco. I worked with their in-house design and marketing teams to build out a custom, responsive WordPress theme. It includes [product pages](https://zignallabs.com/products/zignal-command-center/), a [sortable resource library](https://zignallabs.com/resources/), a contact page with [Google Map integration](https://zignallabs.com/contact/) and lots of zigzags.
