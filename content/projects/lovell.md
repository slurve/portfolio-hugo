Suzanne Lovell is a award-winning architect and interior designer based in Chicago. I again collaborated with another amazing designer to build a component system that in-house editors could use to build [blog posts](https://suzannelovellinc.com/blog/a-spun-chair/), [case studies](https://suzannelovellinc.com/portfolio/gulf-coast-penthouse/) and general content pages. Each page on the site is generated from responsive components that can be re-ordered and dragged/dropped as needed.
