Collaborating with the mighty [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/), I took the role of lead designer on the redesign of Uwishunu, a popular events website in Philadelphia. This project involved several onsite meetings at the clients' office, storyboarding ideas and talking through site features. A lot of time was spent on the [list template](https://www.uwishunu.com/2019/05/philly-food-drink-picks-vegan-eats-indian-cooking-mothers-day-deals-and-more/), which is used extensively throughout the website. WebDevStudios did an amazing job hooking into a maps API to bring these pages to life.
