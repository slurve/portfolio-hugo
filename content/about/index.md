<p class="lead">Hi there. I’m Tom Rose, a freelance web developer with over 20 years experience building websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have a strong passion for web standards, clean code and keeping things simple. Over the years, I’ve worked internationally, in-house and remotely for dozens of organizations large and small.</p>

I’ll often use [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as a content management system, building custom themes by hand with a strong focus on simplicity and usability -- both for the editor and the end user. WordPress powers roughly 30% of the internet, so it's a dependable and trusted CMS. I've also developed a recent interest in static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In fact, this site is built with Hugo. It's a great, lightweight alternative to WordPress in certain situations.

Anyway, I work remotely from my home office in Berlin, but I’m always willing to join teams onsite. I’m also available for consulting with organizations on best practices for content management systems, web hosting setup and deployment processes.

Let’s work together! I’d love to hear more about your project.
