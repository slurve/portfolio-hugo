<p class="lead">Hallo! I’m Tom Rose, a freelance web developer with over 20 years experience building websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have a strong passion for web standards, clean code and keeping things simple. Over the years, I’ve worked internationally, in-house and remotely for dozens of organizations large and small.</p>

I’ll often use WordPress as a content management system, building custom themes from scratch with a focus on simplicity and usability - both for the editor and the end user.

I work remotely from my home office in Berlin, but I’m always willing to join teams onsite.

I’m also available for consulting with organizations on best practices for content management systems, web hosting setup and deployment processes.

Let’s work together! I’d love to hear more about your project.
